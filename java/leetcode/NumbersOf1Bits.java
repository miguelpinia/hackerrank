/**
 *
 * 191. Number of 1 Bits
 *
 *Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of
 * set bits
 * it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 11
 *
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 128
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 2147483645
 *
 * Output: 30
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 231 - 1
 *
 *
 * Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
