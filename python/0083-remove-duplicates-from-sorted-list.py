# 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
# Solved
# Easy
# Topics
# Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such
# that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted
# as well.

# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1,1,2]
# Output: [1,2]

# Example 2:
# Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
# Output: [1,2,3]

# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head: return None
        curr = head
        nxt = head.next
        while nxt:
            if curr.val == nxt.val:
                curr.next = nxt.next
                nxt       = nxt.next
            else:
                curr = nxt
                nxt  = nxt.next
        return head
